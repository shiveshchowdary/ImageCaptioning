# Image Captioning Project

![Image Captioning Model](imgs/modelimg.PNG)

## Overview

This project is aimed at generating descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. It combines computer vision and natural language processing to automatically generate captions that describe the content of the images.

## Model Architecture

We have employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image feature extraction and a recurrent neural network (RNN) for generating captions. The model architecture can be summarized as follows:

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

2. **Data:** Load the flicker 8k image dataset and the corresponding captions. Organize them properly and preprocess the data as required.

3. **Training:** Train the image captioning model using the dataset.

4. **Inference:** Use the trained model to generate captions for images. You can see the code for inference in repo.

## Model Performance

Our trained model has been able to generate captions that are both accurate and relevant to the images. Here are a few sample predictions:

## Further Improvements

While our image captioning model performs well, there's always room for improvement. Some potential areas for enhancement include:

- **Larger Dataset:** Training on a larger and more diverse dataset can improve the model's ability to describe a wider range of images accurately.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

- **Fine-tuning:** You can fine-tune the model using transfer learning techniques by starting with a pre-trained CNN.
